# exit_interview_analysis
## Analysis
- This project cleans, analyzes, and visualizes the exit interviews of two Australian organizations DETE(Department of Eduaction, Training and Employment) and TAFE(Technival and Further Education).

## Question That Needs Answered
- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?

## Steps
1. Clean Column Names
2. Filter the Data
3. Verify the Data Accuracy
4. Identify Dissatisfied Employees
5. Identify the Amount of Time Employees Worked (end_date - start_date)
6. Combine both data sets into one
7. Complete Analysis and visualize findings

# Next Steps
- Clean the age column. How many people in each age group resgined due to some kind of dissatisfaction?
- Instead of analyzing the survey results together, analyze each survey separately. Did more employees in the DETE survey or TAFE survey end their employment because they were dissatisfied in some way?
